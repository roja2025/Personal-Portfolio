## Title: Personal Portfolio Webpage
The objective of this task was to design and develop a basic personal portfolio website using only HTML and CSS. The portfolio serves as a digital resume, showcasing the developer’s skills, academic background, projects, certifications, and contact details in a clean and organized manner. This project helped reinforce my understanding of front-end web development, focusing particularly on building responsive layouts, implementing design consistency, and creating an intuitive user experience without using JavaScript.

To begin with, I planned the structure and layout of the site. Since the deliverable was a single-page portfolio with navigation, I used the <nav> element to create a fixed navigation bar that includes internal anchor links directing to different sections like About, Skills, Projects, Internship, Education, Certificates, Memberships, Hackathons, and Contact. Each section is marked with a unique ID, enabling smooth scroll navigation within the same page. This also promotes good accessibility and user experience.

For the design aspect, I used CSS to define the layout and styling. I selected the ‘Poppins’ font from Google Fonts to maintain a modern and clean typography style across the page. The color scheme included deep blues for headers and background gradients, paired with contrasting white and light grey backgrounds to make the content easy to read. Each section was spaced out evenly with padding and margin, and section headers were styled in a consistent manner to reflect a professional tone.

I made sure the website was responsive using media queries and CSS Grid/Flexbox to adapt the layout for various screen sizes, including tablets and mobile phones. For example, in the projects and education sections, I used CSS Grid to display items in columns on larger screens and in a stacked layout on smaller devices. This ensures that users have a consistent experience regardless of the device they use to access the website.

## Each content section was carefully crafted:

-The About section includes a brief introduction and highlights of my academic journey.

-The Education section is presented in a card-based layout showing my schooling and college background with CGPA and years.

-The Skills section lists both technical and soft skills grouped clearly.

-The Projects section summarizes key academic and personal projects with simple descriptions.

-The Internship, Hackathon, Membership, and Certificates sections describe my professional exposure and achievements.

-Finally, the Contact section provides location, email, phone number, and links to LinkedIn and GitHub, all styled inside a card with interactive links.

A downloadable resume button is also included in the top right corner of the homepage for recruiters to easily access my resume. The overall layout is animated with subtle CSS transitions and fade-in effects for better user interaction.

The footer includes copyright details with the year and my name, maintaining the branding throughout.

Through this task, I gained hands-on experience in implementing HTML structure, CSS styling, and responsiveness. I also understood the importance of layout planning, user interface consistency, and accessibility in web design. By avoiding JavaScript, I focused entirely on mastering HTML and CSS capabilities, which is essential for building a strong front-end foundation.

This portfolio now acts as my professional identity online and can be continuously updated as I progress in my career. It not only meets academic expectations but is also deployment-ready and hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access and sharing.
